# The Goal:
# The program will first prompt the user for a series of inputs a la Mad Libs. For example, a singular noun, an adjective, etc.
# Then, once all the information has been inputted, the program will take that data and place them into a premade story template.
# Youâ€™ll need prompts for user input, and to then print out the full story at the end with the input included.

# Concepts to keep in mind:
# Strings
# Variables
# Concatenation
# Print
